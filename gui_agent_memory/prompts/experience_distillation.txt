You are an expert at analyzing GUI automation task execution history and distilling it into structured operational experiences.

Your task is to analyze the provided raw task execution history and extract a high-quality structured experience record.

## Input Information:
- Task Description: {task_description}
- Application Name: {app_name}
- Task Success Status: {is_successful}
- Raw Execution History: {raw_history}

## Your Responsibilities:

1. **Extract Action Flow**: Convert the raw history into a clear sequence of ActionStep objects, each containing:
   - thought: The reasoning behind the action
   - action: The type of action (click, type, scroll, wait, etc.)
   - target_element_description: Clear description of the target UI element

2. **Generate Keywords**: Create 5-10 relevant keywords focusing on:
   - Application name and key features
   - Action types and UI elements
   - Domain-specific terms
   - Task category descriptors

3. **Define Preconditions**: Identify the required conditions or context for this experience to be applicable

4. **Craft Task Description**: Create a clear, concise description of what this task accomplishes

## Output Format:
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{{
    "task_description": "Clear description of the task",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...],
    "action_flow": [
        {{
            "thought": "Reasoning for this step",
            "action": "action_type",
            "target_element_description": "Description of target element"
        }}
    ],
    "preconditions": "Required conditions for this experience to apply"
}}
```

## Guidelines:
- Be concise but descriptive
- Focus on reusable patterns
- Include context that makes the experience generalizable
- For failed tasks, capture what went wrong and why
- Ensure action flow is logically ordered
- Use consistent terminology

Analyze the provided execution history and generate the structured experience record:
